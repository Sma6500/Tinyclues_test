# Project for TinyClues MLE Internship

## Introduction

This is the interview project that I got for applying to the Tinyclues MLE internship position.


I needed to implement a code that give movies' recommendations given a dataset and 
that would allow the following improvements.
- Introduce easily new features.
- Apply the code to other datasets or variations of the tasks.
- Evaluate performances.
- Test the code.


## Answer 

In order to fullfill the terms' above I reorganized the code.

- I built an absract class : Recommendation. The inherited classes Recommendation_cat and Recommendation_??? are two differents way to give some recommandation for a given user.
- In the utils directory I built the movies.py file with all the function allowing to process the movies' data.
- In the test directory I built some test file in order to test and evaluate the code's performances.
